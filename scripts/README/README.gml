	Example project made by @Trixelized

	The macros n_white and n_black hold the color codes!
	They work just like the built in color codes (eg. c_red or make_color_rgb();)

	If you are going to change the resolution (for some reason)
	make sure to change them inside the init and room views as well!
	But the resolution should be good ;)


	nokia_play_sound makes all other sounds stop (because nokia sounds overlap)
